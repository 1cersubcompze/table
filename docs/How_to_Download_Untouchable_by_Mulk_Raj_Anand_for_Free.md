## What is Untouchable by Mulk Raj Anand About?
 
If you are curious about what Untouchable by Mulk Raj Anand is about, here is a brief summary of the plot and the themes of the novel.
 
The novel is set in the fictional town of Bulashah, in the Punjab province of British India. The protagonist, Bakha, is a young man who works as a sweeper and a latrine cleaner. He belongs to the caste of untouchables, who are considered impure and polluted by the upper castes. They are not allowed to touch or interact with anyone from a higher caste, and they have to live in segregated and filthy slums.
 
The novel follows Bakha's life for one day, from dawn to dusk. During this day, he faces various humiliations and injustices from the people around him. He is slapped by a high-caste man for accidentally touching him. He is denied water from a public well by a priest. He is exploited by a shopkeeper who gives him stale bread. He is rejected by a girl he likes because of his caste. He is harassed by a policeman who accuses him of stealing. He is mocked by a group of children who throw stones at him.
 
However, Bakha also encounters some glimpses of hope and compassion. He meets a Christian missionary who offers him education and salvation. He meets a poet who praises his dignity and courage. He meets Mahatma Gandhi, who advocates for the abolition of untouchability and the upliftment of the oppressed. He also meets a friend who tells him about a new invention: the flush toilet, which could eliminate the need for sweepers and latrines.
 
By the end of the day, Bakha is confused and conflicted about his identity and his future. He wonders whether he should convert to Christianity, follow Gandhi's movement, or embrace modernity. He also realizes that he has a voice and a will of his own, and that he does not have to accept his fate as an untouchable.
 
Untouchable by Mulk Raj Anand is a powerful and realistic portrayal of the plight of the lowest caste in India. It exposes the cruelty and hypocrisy of the caste system, and the suffering and resilience of the untouchables. It also explores the themes of colonialism, nationalism, religion, social reform, and human dignity. It is a novel that challenges the reader to empathize with Bakha and his fellow untouchables, and to question the social norms that oppress them.
